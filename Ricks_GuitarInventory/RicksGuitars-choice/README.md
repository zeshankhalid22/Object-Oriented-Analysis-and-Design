### Problems and their solutions
- because in our search function, string comparison is Case-Sensitive, it may be possible
we entered the correct string and didn't able to match

- we are also comparing every customer-requirement inside search function,
it is also possible not to match only 1 condition and maybe customer could 
sacrifice 1 thing
