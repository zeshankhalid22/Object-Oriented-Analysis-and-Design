## problem Description
Just a few months ago, Rick decided to throw out his paper-based system
for keeping track of guitars, and start using a computer-based system
to store his inventory. He hired a popular programming firm,
Down and Dirty Coding, and they've already built him an inventory management app.
He's even had the firm build him a new search tool to help him match
up a customer to their dream instrument.


*now Rick*:
You wouldn't believe
the selection we have here.
Come on in, tell us about what kind of guitar you like,
and we'll find you the perfect instrument, guaranteed!

## Some analysis

### What does great software mean?
it depends on many things

#### First, the great software must satisfy the customer
simple definition of great software is it should just work.
we just take customers requirements, analyse then and try to make it workable.

#### Applying basic Object-Oriented Principles
Once software works, look at duplicated/repeated code, and try to implement
DRY (do not repeat yourself) principle
